Script that generates a Spotify playlist with all songs Bad Bunny's been in, ordered by release date

## Instructions
- Clone repo
- Install Spotipy
- Get API keys from Spotify
- Set Spotipy env variables with API client key and secret
- Run script (you'll wanna change the playlist ID and maybe also artist ID if you're doing this for a diff artist)
